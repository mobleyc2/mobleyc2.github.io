I heavily based my HTML assignment on a template I use on Wix. The layout of the various pages is heavily based on the format of the Wix template.
Some changes I made from the template include changing the fonts, colors, and slightly adjusting the look of the nav bar. 
The color palatte was generated with a generator I used. I enjoyed the neutral tones and thought it suited the identity I wanted to potray. 
The fonts I chose are just fonts I personally enjoy and think work well together. I also think the fonts I chose go well with the color scheme. 
The images I chose are the ones that I thought best displayed my identity and my work.
