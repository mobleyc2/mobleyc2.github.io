I heavily based my HTML assignment on a template I use on Wix. The layout of the various pages is heavily based on the format of the Wix template. I did not use/copy any code from the template, I just tried to use my own skills to replicate it. 
Some changes I made from the template include changing the fonts, colors, and slightly adjusting the look of the nav bar. I wanted my nav bar to be more spread out and
to be a little more clean to look at. I also adjusted some sizing of various elements to improve the overall look and feel of the site. 


The color palatte was generated with a generator I used. I enjoyed the neutral tones and thought it suited the identity I wanted to potray. 
The fonts I chose are just fonts I personally enjoy and think work well together. I also think the fonts I chose go well with the color scheme. 
The images I chose are the ones that I thought best displayed my identity and my work. 

The JavaScript function I included was a simple function that changes the header on the main page depending on the time of day.
